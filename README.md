This project's goal was to develop a game in the Unity game engine. Using 3D graphics and C#, I had free range to develop whatever game I desired. I had to use creativity to come up with a concept and execute it.

This repository contains the executable for the final game. Just download the executable and run in order to play the final game.

The scripts folder contains all the C# scripts I coded for the game within unity.
